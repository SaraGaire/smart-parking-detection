# SMART PARKING DETCETION
A simple project using Ardunio. Here, we will be using cpp for the coding part and python for the controlling.


#FEATURES
- Detects if a parking spot is occupied or available
- Controls a servo motor barrier gate
- RGB LED shows status (Green = available, Red = occupied, Blue = error)
- Buzzer gives sound signals when cars arrive or leave
- Manual commands via Serial Monitor (`o` = open, `c` = close, `s` = status, `r` = reset)

#COMPONENTS
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- RGB LED
- Servo motor
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires & breadboard
